			<center><p>"Do not fret adventurer, I do not intend to let you go on your journey without assistance, although our people, the fairies, do not interfere with mortals and their constant wars, this evil is more than just a mortal feud, the fairies themselves are in danger this time and so I, Alfryda, ruler of the fairies, will grant you the power to destroy this evil. Before I grant you this power, I must ask you a question, it would be useless of me to give you a power you cannot use. So adventurer, I will give you three options, you choose what fits your personality and values. I will not judge you on your choice, as long as you dedicate yourself to helping our world. Now adventurer, make your choice"</p></center>
